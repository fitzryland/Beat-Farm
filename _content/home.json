Dallas, OR 97338](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Turning+Earth+Farms/@44.840048,-123.388839,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xce615d5149c3ac77!8m2!3d44.840048!4d-123.388839).  It’s about an hour and 20 minutes from Portland, outside of Salem.  To give you an idea of what typically goes on at the farm, check out this video: <https://vimeo.com/187775426>\n\n#### When\n\nThursday July 16th to Sunday July 19th. You can arrive anytime starting Thursday to help setup. Music will begin on Friday. You have to pack everything out and leave on Sunday.\n\n#### Arrival\n\nYou’ll see a sign at the gate that says Turning Earth Farms. If the gate is closed, open the gate to enter and make sure to close the gate behind you. There are animals running around the farm so if you use a gate, leave it as you found it. Follow the road past the main house, and there will be some volunteers helping direct you to where to park. You’ll park just a little ways outside the forest, but you’ll need to transport your things a couple minutes to your campsite by foot. If you think you’re going to arrive late at night, please let someone else attending know so we can look out for you.\n\n#### Camping\n\nThere’s plenty of space to setup your camp in the woods. People working on the farm will be camping closer to the entrance to the forest but Beat Farm will have the bulk of it. There is a bonfire area near the stage. No smaller campfires."
